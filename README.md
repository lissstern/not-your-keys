Blockchain Private Key Vulnerability List

## Bitcoin

* **[Recovering Bitcoin private keys using weak signatures from the blockchain](https://web.archive.org/web/20130314180507/http://www.nilsschneider.net/2013/01/28/recovering-bitcoin-private-keys.html)** - January 2013, discovered a potential weakness in some Bitcoin implementations. ECDSA requires a random number for each signature. If this random number is ever used twice with the same private key it can be recovered. This transaction was generated by a hardware bitcoin wallet using a pseudo-random number generator that was returning the same “random” number every time. **Results**: over 285 bitcoin addresses compromised.

## Ethereum

* **[Finding Over 732 Active Private Keys On Ethereum's Blockchain](https://www.ise.io/casestudies/ethercombing/)** - April 2019, focus on eight 32-bit “sub-regions” in the 256-bit key space where are likely to observe Ethereum addresses in use that have resulted from a weak private key. This gives eight regions with a possible 2^32 -1 (i.e., ~4.3 billion) combinations per region. The above key space ranges, while making up an infinitesimal part of the 256-bit key space, are some areas that private keys might exist in due to errors or other factors compromising randomness of a 256-bit key. **Results**: discovered 49,060 transactions spread over 732 public keys for which the private key was found, with a total transfer amount of more than 32 Ethereum.
